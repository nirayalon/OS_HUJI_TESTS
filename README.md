# OS Tests Repository 
Welcome to our OS Tests Repository! 🦾
This is where we publish the tests for our home exercises as part of the Operating Systems course at the Hebrew University in 2023. 
Our goal is to create simple, understandable tests that are easy to debug, so you can use them to test and debug your own code.
